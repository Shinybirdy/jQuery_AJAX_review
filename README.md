When JavaScript is executed, synchronous code can block further execution of any code
until it has finished what itâ€™s doing. This is boring and terrible. 
Asynchronous code allows code that's ready to run just can go ahead without waiting for slow-poke scripts. 
Like using the Fast Pass at Disney World, or ordering Starbucks from your phone... kind of. Way better.
