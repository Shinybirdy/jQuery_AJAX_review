JavaScript and JQuery review with an AJAX call.

When JavaScript is executed, synchronous code can block further execution of any other code
until it has finished what itâ€™s doing. This is boring and terrible. 
Asynchronous code allows the bits of code that are ready to just GO AHEAD without waiting for slow-pokey scripts. 
Like using the Fast Pass at Disney World, or ordering Starbucks from your phone... kind of. 
Since we are using AJAX here, the work is being done on the client-side.
